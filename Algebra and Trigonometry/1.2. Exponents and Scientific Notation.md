#### The Product Rule of Exponents
For any real number and natural numbers and the product rule of exponents states that
$$x^m + x^n = x^{m+n}$$
#### The Quotient Rule of Exponents
For any real number $a$ and $b$ natural numbers and such that $m>n$ the quotient rule of exponents states that
$$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$$
